# Predict Next-day rain in Austrailia
## About the data set
This dataset contains comprehensive weather measurements collected from 49 different meteorological centers. It includes key parameters such as temperature, evaporation, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, and an indicator for whether it rained that day (RainToday).
## Problem Statement
In this analysis, we aim to train a binary classification model using logistic regression to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia. The model is developed based on various weather features, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, to enhance predictive accuracy.
## Project Overview
